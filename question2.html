        <h1>Question 2: Compare CLI vs. GUI clients for working 
with Git</h1>
        <p>
		Git is a popular DVCS and it could be controlled with a bash CLI or some GUI 
interfaces. 
        </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Git CLI is very powerful and robust. The best thing is that it does not have 
many commands to remember. Only a few are used frequesntly to do most of the work.</li>
		<li>There are many GUI interfaces to be used with the Git like gitk, Git GUI etc</li>
		<li>gitk is more like git log --graph and shows history of commits etc. Git GUI on 
the other hand is a GUI interface to craft commits.</li>
	</ul>
