	<h1>Question 1: Argue 2 advantages of Git DVCS over Dropbox</h1>
	<p>
		There are many benefits of using Git DVCS over Dropbox and some of them are listed 
below:
	</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Dropbox will keep different versions of each file but Git on the other hand
keeps versions of the whole project. This is an advantage because correcting each file can be prone to
error and troublesome. </li>
                        <li>In Dropbox you can not compare different versions easily but in Git one can
easily run &quote;diff&quote; comparing the previous versions with the current.</li>
                        <li>Git gives meaningful descriptions with each change while Dropbox only
saves each version with numbers i.e. version 1 2 3 4 etc.</li>
                </ul>
